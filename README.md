##### The Riverside Standard.

---

The Riverside Standard (RVS) has been documented in lots of different places, with various different versions and lots of inconsistencies.
This repo aims to unify them with a single standard with its own versioning system, the Riverside Standard Extended (RVSX).

The Riverside Standard consists of documentation, templates and libraries that demonstrate how to build a modern production app, and contains various utilities that aid in doing so.

---

### `Riverside.Standard`

The `Riverside.Standard` class library contains helpers and classes that complement the actual Standard documentation itself and enforce it as a rich code analysis tool.

### `Riverside.Runtime`

This class library contains various resources that enable the implementation of the Riverside Standard in an agnostic manner.
